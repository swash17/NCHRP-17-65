These highways may connect larger municipalities but often travel through one or more small cities/towns. They are usually more varied in horizontal and vertical alignment than urban roadways. They may consist of combinations of two-lane highway, multilane highway, and occasional intersections (signals, roundabouts). As urban areas continue to see growth further away from the central cities, rural highways in previously less developed areas are experiencing increases in traffic demand. Additionally, as urban area congestion continues to build, shipping companies are more frequently considering less congested two-lane and multilane highways in their routing decisions. The presence of commercial trucks on rural, particularly two-lane, highways pose additional challenges for maintaining acceptable levels of operational performance due to more variance in the geometric design of these facilities and less favorable passing opportunities. Because of the extended lengths of rural highways and the variation in cross-section elements, it is very challenging to assess the operational quality of these highways across extended lengths (many miles) with the current analysis methodologies of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (TRB, 2016). The results from NCHRP Project 17-65, Improved Analysis of Two-Lane Highway Capacity and Operational Performance (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018), advanced the capabilities of the HCM two-lane highway analysis methodology (Chapter 15). One major revision was the establishment of an analysis framework that was more amenable to a facility-level analysis approach than the previous analysis methodology. This framework provides for subdividing an extended length of two-lane highway into multiple contiguous segments of different types (passing constrained, passing zone, passing/climbing lane) that can be analyzed individually and collectively. However, there are still limitations in this methodology that need to be addressed to be able provide for a more comprehensive evaluation of rural highways, such as the impacts of intersections and short sections of multilane highway. It is important to continue to extend the capabilities of the HCM analysis methodologies, particularly at the facility-level, so that roadway design and traffic engineers have the analysis tools they need for performing accurate and comprehensive facility evaluations. Furthermore, this is consistent with the fact that drivers typically evaluate the quality of their trip over its entire length, not just in separate segments. When developing traffic analysis methodologies for the HCM, it is also important to consider the potential interaction between it and the preeminent roadway design reference, AASHTOs A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (aka the Green Book) (2018). With the recently released 7th edition of the Green Book, and its incorporation of new context classifications and discussion of the interrelationship of functional and context classifications, this project should take advantage of how these new Green Book features can inform the development of a rural highway traffic analysis methodology. The objective of this research is to 1) develop reliability and quality of service predictive methodologies for rural road facilities accounting for the new context and functional classifications of the Green Book. The methodologies could be incorporated into the Green Book and into the HCM, and 2) develop a guidebook on application of the methodologies for a broad range of users. The resulting methods will lead to a rural highway facilities procedure suitable for incorporation into a future edition of the HCM. "],["example-problem-1.html", "3 Example Problem 1 3.1 Level, Straight, Passing Constrained Segment", " 3 Example Problem 1 3.1 Level, Straight, Passing Constrained Segment This example problem illustrates the computation of the LOS in a single direction on a straight, 0.75-mi-long Passing Constrained segment in level terrain. This example problem follows the flowchart of analysis steps outlined in Exhibit 15-9. The Facts The segment has the following known characteristics: Segment length = 3,960 ft (0.75 mi); Segment type = Passing Constrained; No upstream passing lanes; Vehicle count in the analysis direction = 752 veh/h; PHF = 0.94; Posted speed limit: 50 mi/h; Percent heavy vehicles (%HV) = 5%; Percent grade = 0%; Horizontal curvature = none; Lane width = 12 ft; Shoulder width = 6 ft; and Access points = 0. Objective Estimate the LOS in the subject direction on the two-lane highway segment as described. Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation The limits of the segment were identified following the guidance given in Step 1 on page 15-15. The characteristics of this segment were determined by examination to be essentially homogenous. These characteristics included the ability to pass, lane geometry, grades, lane and shoulder widths, posted speed limit, traffic demands, adjacent land uses, and driveways. A field examination of the segment determined that it met the definition of a Passing Constrained segment, being a segment in which passing in the oncoming lane is either prohibited or is effectively negligible due to geometric or sight distance limitations. Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio In this step, the hourly demand volume at the upstream entrance of the directional segment being evaluated is converted to a peak 15-min flow rate by applying the peak hour factor (PHF) using Equation 15-1: \\[v_{d} = \\frac{V_{d}}{\\text{PHF}} = \\frac{752}{0.94} = 800\\ \\text{veh/h}\\] The capacity of a Passing Constrained segment is 1,700 veh/h, as stated in the description of Step 2 on page 15-18. The demand flow rate is less than capacity; therefore the calculation process proceeds to Step 3.Note that it is only necessary to compute the actual opposing flow rate for Passing Zone segments. Step 3: Determine Vertical Alignment Classification The segment is assigned a vertical alignment classification of 1, based on Exhibit 15-11 for a level (0% grade), 0.75-mi-long segment. From Exhibit 15-10, the segment length of 0.75 mi is between the minimum (0.25 mi) and maximum (3.0 mi) lengths for a Passing Constrained segment of vertical class 1, and therefore no adjustment is needed to the segment length. Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed As stated on page 15-18, direct field measurement of FFS is preferred. In this case it is not feasible to measure the FFS, so it will be estimated using the procedure given in Step 4. Because this is a Passing Constrained segment, the opposing flow rate vo is set at 1,500 veh/h in Equation 15-4 for the purposes of computing FFS, regardless of the actual opposing flow rate. First, the base free-flow speed BFFS is estimated using Equation 15-2. Next, Equation 15-4 through Equation 15-6 are used to determine factors relating to lane and shoulder width, access-point density, and heavy-vehicle percentage, which are used in the estimation of FFS. Finally, the FFS is estimated by Equation 15-3. \\[BFFS = 1.14 \\times S_{\\text{pl}} = 1.14 \\times 50 = 57.0\\ \\text{mi/h}\\] \\[f_{LS} = 0.6 \\times (12 - LW) + 0.7 \\times (6 - SW)\\] \\[f_{LS} = 0.6 \\times (12 - 12) + 0.7 \\times (6 - 6) = 0\\] \\[f_{A} = \\text{min}\\left( \\frac{ {APD}}{4},10 \\right) = \\text{min}\\left( \\frac{0}{4},10 \\right) = 0\\] \\[a = \\text{max}\\lbrack 0.0333,\\ 0\\rbrack = 0.0333\\] \\[FFS = BFFS - a(HV\\%)\\] \\[FFS = 57.0 - (0.0333)(5) - 0 - 0 = 56.83 \\text{ mi/h}\\] There are no geometry-related FFS adjustments for 12-ft lanes and 6-ft shoulders. There are also no adjustments for access points (driveways or streets), because this segment has no access points. Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed Because the demand flow rate in the subject direction is greater than 100 veh/h, the equations given in Step 5 are used to estimate the average speed. Step 5a: Calculate the Slope Coefficient The slope coefficient m determines how rapidly the average speed is estimated to decrease as a function of the entering flow rate. It is computed as a function of six coefficients b0 to b5, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-13 for a Passing Constrained segment. For a segment of vertical class 1, these coefficients are 0.0558, 0.0542, 0.3278, 0.1029, 0, and 0, respectively. Equation 15-8 is then used to determine the slope coefficient. \\[m = \\text{max}\\left\\lbrack b_{5},b_{0} + b_{1} \\times FFS + b_{2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{v_{o}}{1,000}} + \\text{max}\\left( 0,b_{3} \\right) \\times \\sqrt{L} + \\text{max}\\left( 0,b_{4} \\right) \\times \\sqrt{HV\\%} \\right\\rbrack\\] \\[m = \\text{max}\\left\\lbrack 0,0.0558 + 0.0542 \\times 56.83 + 0.3278 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1,500}{1,000}} + \\text{max}(0,\\ 0.1029) \\\\ \\times \\sqrt{0.75} + \\text{max}(0,\\ 0) \\times \\sqrt{5}\\right\\rbrack\\] \\[m = 3.626\\] Step 5b: Calculate the Power Coefficient The power coefficient p is used to estimate how fast the average speed decreases at higher flow rates. The equation uses nine coefficients f0 to f8, which are obtained from Exhibit 15-19 for a Passing Constrained segment. For a segment of vertical class 1, all of these coefficients take on values of 0, except for f0 (0.67576), f3 (0.12060), and f4 (0.35919). Equation 15-11 is then used to determine the power coefficient. \\[p = \\text{max}\\left\\lbrack f_{8},f_{0} + f_{1} \\times FFS + f_{2} \\times L + f_{3} \\times \\frac{v_{o}}{1,000} + f_{4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{v_{o}}{1,000}} \\\\ + f_{5} \\times HV\\% + f_{6} \\times \\sqrt{HV\\%} + f_{7} \\times (L \\times HV\\%) \\right\\rbrack\\] \\[p = \\text{max}\\left\\lbrack 0,0.67576 + 0 \\times 56.83 + 0 \\times 0.75 + 0.12060 \\times \\frac{1,500}{1,000} - 0.35919 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1,500}{1,000}} \\\\ + 0 \\times 5 + 0 \\times \\sqrt{5} + 0 \\times (0.75 \\times 5) \\right\\rbrack\\] \\[p = 0.41676\\] Step 5c: Calculate Average Speed for the Segment The average speed for the given entry flow rate is computed in Step 5-3 using Equation 15-7. The previously computed flow rate vd, slope coefficient m, and power coefficient p are used in this equation. \\[S = FFS - {m\\left( \\frac{v_{d}}{1,000} - 0.1 \\right)}^{p}\\] \\[S = 56.83 - {3.626\\left( \\frac{800}{1,000} - 0.1 \\right)}^{0.41676}\\] \\[S = 53.7\\ \\text{mi/h}\\] Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment Because this is a straight segment, no adjustment to the speed estimate is required for horizontal alignment. Assessment of Speed Results The average speed at a directional flow rate of 800 veh/h is estimated to be approximately 3 mi/h (about 5%) lower than the FFS, but about 4 mi/h (about 7%) higher than the posted speed limit. Step 6: Estimate the Percent Followers The service measure percent followers is estimated in Step 6 for the given flow rate vd. under the prevailing geometric conditions and percent heavy vehicles. First, the percent followers at 100% of capacity is estimated. Next, the percent followers at 25% of capacity is estimated. Then, the slope and power coefficients for an exponential curve fitting those two points (percent followers at 25% and 100% capacity) are estimated. Finally, the fitted curve is used to estimate the percent followers for the given flow rate. Step 6a: Compute Percent Followers at Capacity Percent followers at capacity is calculated using Equation 15-18, applying eight parameters b0 to b7 obtained from Exhibit 15-24. \\({PF}_{cap} = b_{0} + b_{1}(L) + b_{2}\\left(\\sqrt{L} \\right) + b_{3}\\left({FFS} \\right) \\\\+ b_{4}\\left( \\sqrt{FFS} \\right) + b_{5}(HV\\%) + \\ b_{6}\\left( FFS \\times \\frac{v_{o}}{1,000} \\right) + b_{7}\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{v_{0}}{1,000}} \\right)\\) \\({PF}_{cap} = 37.68080 + 3.05089(0.75) - 7.90866\\left( \\sqrt{0.75} \\right) - 0.94321(56.83) \\\\ + 13.64266\\left( \\sqrt{56.83} \\right) - 0.00050(5) - 0.05500\\left(56.83 \\times \\frac{1,500}{1,000} \\right) + 7.1376\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1,500}{1,000}} \\right)\\) \\[{PF}_{cap} = 86.41\\%\\] Step 6b: Compute Percent Followers at 25% Capacity Percent followers at 25 percent of capacity is calculated using Equation 15-20, applying eight parameters c0 to c7 obtained from Exhibit 15-26. \\[{PF}_{25cap} = c_{0} + c_{1}(L) + c_{2}\\left( \\sqrt{L} \\right) + c_{3}\\left({FFS} \\right) + c_{4}\\left( \\sqrt{\\text{FFS}} \\right) + c_{5}(HV\\%) + c_{6}\\left( FFS \\times \\frac{v_{o}}{1,000} \\right) \\\\ + c_{7}\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{v_{0}}{1,000}} \\right)\\] \\[{PF}_{25cap} = 18.01780 + 10.00000(0.75) - 21.60000\\left( \\sqrt{0.75} \\right) - 0.97853(56.83) \\\\ + 12.05214\\left( \\sqrt{56.83} \\right) - 0.00750(5) - 0.06700\\left( 56.83 \\times \\frac{1,500}{1,000} \\right) + 11.6041\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1,500}{1,000}} \\right)\\] \\[{PF}_{25cap} = 50.52\\%\\] Step 6c: Calculate the Slope Coefficient Equation 15-22 is used to compute the slope coefficient m for an exponential curve fitted between percent following at capacity and percent following at 25% capacity.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to follower density and Step 9 is skipped. Step 10: Determine LOS The segments LOS is determined from Exhibit 15-6, using the column for a higher-speed highway (posted speed limit equal to or greater than 50 mi/h). With 10.1 followers/mi, the subject direction of travel on the segment operates at LOS D. Discussion The estimated FFS and average speed for a flow rate of 800 veh/h are both above the posted speed limit. This result is reasonable for a flat, straight segment in this volume range. However, the follower density produces LOS D operations. This flow rate is large enough to produce fairly high levels of platooning, but not so high as to cause significant reductions in speed. The combination of a moderately high flow rate and moderately high level of platooning will result in travelers perceiving a relatively poor level of service.

The Facts The segment to be evaluated has the same general demand and geometric characteristics as the segment evaluated in Example Problem 1. The difference is that this segment has horizontal curvature instead of being straight; otherwise, the same inputs are used as for Example Problem 1. The segment is split into 11 subsegments, with each subsegment being either straight (tangent) or curved. Horizontal curvature data for each subsegment is provided in Exhibit 1.

Objective Estimate the average speed in the subject direction on the two-lane highway taking into account the effects of horizontal alignment on the average speed. Step 1: Identify Facility Study Boundaries and Segmentation This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal alignment does not affect the selection of study boundaries and segmentation. Step 2: Determine Demand Flow Rates, Capacity, and d/c Ratio This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal alignment does not affect the computation of the demand flow rates. Step 3: Determine the Vertical Alignment Classification This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The horizontal alignment does not affect the determination of the vertical alignment classification. Step 4: Determine the Free-Flow Speed This step was completed in Example Problem 1. The computed base FFS applies to the tangent subsegments. Step 5: Estimate the Average Speed Steps 5a, 5b, and 5c were applied in Example Problem 1 to obtain the following speed results for the tangent subsegments: Base free-flow speed BFFS = 57.0 mi/h, Tangent free-flow speed FFS = 56.8 mi/h, and Average speed for tangent subsegments S = 53.7 mi/h. Step 5d: Adjust Speed for Horizontal Alignment In this step, the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal curve is determined. There are three substeps: (a) identifying the horizontal alignment classification for each subsegment with a horizontal curve, (b) calculating the average speed for each subsegment with a horizontal curve, and (c) calculating the adjusted average speed for the segment. Step 5d.1: Identify all Horizontal Curves Within the Segment In this step the tangent (straight) length, curve radius, and superelevation are identified for each horizontal curve within the segment. Each curve is assigned a horizontal alignment classification on the basis of its radius and percent superelevation, using Exhibit 15-22. The resulting horizontal classes were indicated previously in Exhibit 1. Note that in typical designs, the crown of the roadway (designed to shed water from the paved way) will cause the superelevation to vary by direction of travel. Therefore, a curves horizontal class may also vary by direction of travel. Step 5d.2: Calculate Average Speed for each Horizontal Curve Within the Segment The average speed for a subsegment with horizontal curvature is determined using Equation 15-12 though Equation 15-15. The process is demonstrated for Subsegment 2. Subsegment 2 has a horizontal alignment class of 3 and the BFFS for the preceding tangent section is 57.0 mi/h. Equation 15-14 is applied to compute the base free-flow speed for Subsegment 2: \\[{BFFS}_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}\\left( {BFFS}_{T},44.32 + 0.3728 \\times {BFFS}_{T} - 6.868 \\times {HorizClass}_{2} \\right)\\] \\[{BFFS}_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}(57.0,\\ 44.32 + 0.3728 \\times 57.0 - 6.868 \\times 3)\\] \\[{BFFS}_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}(57.0,\\ 44.9656) = 44.9656\\ \\text{mi/h}\\] Subsegment 2s FFS is computed using Equation 15-13: \\[{FFS}_{HC2} = {BFFS}_{HC2} - 0.0255 \\times HV\\%\\] \\[{FFS}_{HC2} = 44.9656 - 0.0255 \\times 5\\] \\[{FFS}_{HC2} = 44.8381\\ \\text{mi/h} \\] The slope coefficient m used in the determination of average speed is computed using Equation 15-15 as follows: \\[m = \\text{max}\\left( 0.277, - 25.8993 - 0.7756 \\times {FFS}_{HC2} + 10.6294 \\times \\sqrt{{FFS}_{HC2}} + 2.4766 \\times {HorizClass}_{2} \\\\ - 9.8238 \\times \\sqrt{{HorizClass}_{2}} \\right)\\] \\[m = \\text{max}\\left( 0.277, - 25.8993 - 0.7756 \\times 44.8381 + 10.6294 \\times \\sqrt{44.8381} + 2.4766 \\times 3 \\\\ - 9.8238 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\right)\\] \\[m = \\text{max}(0.277,\\ 0.9145) = 0.9145\\] Finally, the average speed of Subsegment 2 is computed by Equation 15-12. \\[S_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}\\left( S,{FFS}_{{HC}2} - m \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{v_{d}}{1,000} - 0.1} \\right)\\] \\[S_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}\\left( 53.7,\\ 44.8381 - 0.9145 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{800}{1,000} - 0.1} \\right)\\] \\[S_{{HC}2} = \\text{min}(53.7,\\ 44.0730) = 44.1\\ \\text{mi/h}\\] Similar computations are performed for the other subsegments with horizontal curves.

Subsegment Type Speed (mi/h) Length (ft) 1 Tangent 3.7 280 2 Horizontal curve 44.1 432 3 Tangent 53.7 260 4 Horizontal curve 37.6 366.5 5 Tangent 53.7 250 6 Horizontal curve 30.9 216 7 Tangent 53.7 275.6 8 Horizontal curve 50.5 458 9 Tangent 53.7 285 10 Horizontal curve 53.7 767.9 11 Tangent 53.7 369 Total 3,960 Equation 15-16 is used to calculate the segments adjusted average speed by taking a length-weighted average of the subsegment speeds. \\[S = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{11}\\left({SubsegSpeed}_{i} \\times{SubsegLength}_{i} \\right)}{L}\\] \\[S = \\frac{\\begin{bmatrix} (53.7 \\times 280) + (44.1 \\times 432) + (53.7 \\times 260) + (37.6 \\times 366.5) \\\\ + (53.7 \\times 250) + (30.9 \\times 216) + (53.7 \\times 275.6) + (50.5 \\times 458) \\\\ + (53.7 \\times 285) + (53.7 \\times 767.9) + (53.7 \\times 369) \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}{3,960}\\] \\[S = 49.5\\ \\text{mi/h}\\] Discussion Compared to the straight segment studied in Example Problem 1, the horizontal curvature in the segment studied in Example Problem 2 reduces the average speed from 53.7 mi/h to 49.5 mi/h, which is close to the segments posted speed limit of 50 mi/h.
